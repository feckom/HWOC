## üöÄ Overview

`HWOC` (Hardware Online Check) is a **Windows-focused**, **Rich-powered**, **offline-first** system information collector that gathers detailed hardware specs from WMI and optionally enriches them using real-time web scraping from trusted sources like **Intel ARK** and **TechPowerUp**.

It's designed as a modern replacement for tools like Speccy or CPU-Z, with support for:
- Compact one-line summaries for quick overviews
- Detailed tabular reports for in-depth analysis
- Automatic HTTP caching to reduce redundant requests
- Parallelized online lookups for speed
- JSON export for automation and scripting

Perfect for IT professionals, overclockers, hardware reviewers, and system administrators.

> ‚ö° **Fast & efficient** ‚Äî caches results and uses concurrent requests.  
> üîç **Smart enrichment** ‚Äî auto-detects Intel CPUs and NVIDIA/AMD GPUs for precise spec lookup.
